[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## The accompanying files are as follows:
1. **run_analysis.R:** This file contains a script that -
    * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for       each activity and each subject.
2. **FinalData.txt:** The cleaned up data set which was the result of the analysis present in the **run_analysis.r**    file.
3. **code_book.md:** A guide that describes the data and its variables
